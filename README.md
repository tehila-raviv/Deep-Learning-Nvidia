## Getting Started with Deep Learning – NVIDIA Course Projects
This repository contains my projects and code implementations from the "Getting Started with Deep Learning" course by NVIDIA. The course provided a hands-on introduction to deep learning concepts, covering computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), transfer learning, and model deployment using PyTorch.

🔍 Course Overview
Deep learning is a powerful AI approach that enables computers to learn patterns and make decisions with high accuracy. This course focused on:

Building deep learning models from scratch and optimizing them for better performance.

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.

Applying data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.

Leveraging pre-trained models and transfer learning to train models efficiently.

Exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) with BERT for text-based tasks.

📌 Topics Covered
✔️ PyTorch fundamentals
✔️ Image classification (MNIST, American Sign Language dataset)
✔️ Building and training CNNs
✔️ Data augmentation techniques
✔️ Deploying deep learning models
✔️ Transfer learning & fine-tuning
✔️ NLP with BERT for text processing
